%description
A list of standardized resource classes for OpenStack.
A resource class is a distinct type of inventory that exists in a cloud
environment, for example VCPU, DISK_GB. They are upper case with underscores.
They often include a unit in their name.
This package provides a collection of symbols representing those standard
resource classes which are expected to be available in any OpenStack deployment.
There also exists a concept of custom resource classes. These are countable
types that are custom to a particular environment. The OpenStack placement
API provides a way to create these. A custom resource class always begins
with a CUSTOM_ prefix.
