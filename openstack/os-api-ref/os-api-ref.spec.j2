%description
This project is a collection of sphinx stanzas that assist in building an API
Reference site for an OpenStack project in RST. RST is great for
unstructured English, but displaying semi structured (and repetitive) data
in tables is not it's strength. This provides tooling to insert semi-structured
data describing request and response parameters, and turn those into nice
tables.
The project also includes a set of styling (and javascript) that is expected
to layer on top of an openstackdocstheme theme base. This provides a nice set
of collapsing sections for REST methods and javascript controls to
expand / collapse all sections.
