%description
A collection of Python deprecation patterns and strategies that help
you collect your technical debt in a non-destructive manner. The goal
of this library is to provide well documented developer facing
deprecation patterns that start of with a basic set and can expand
into a larger set of patterns as time goes on. The desired output of
these patterns is to apply the warnings module to emit
DeprecationWarning or PendingDeprecationWarning or similar derivative
to developers using libraries (or potentially applications) about
future deprecations.
