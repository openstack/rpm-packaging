%description
This package is client for Congress component.
Congress is an open policy framework for the cloud.
Congress fetches information about VMs from Nova,
and network state from Neutron, etc. Congress then
feeds input data from those services into its policy
engine where Congress verifies that the cloud's actual
state abides by the cloud operator's policies. Congress
is designed to work with any policy and any cloud service.
