RPM Packaging for OpenStack README
==================================

RPM packaging for OpenStack provides RPM spec file templates
and tooling for building OpenStack packages for RPM based
distributions.

RPM packaging for OpenStack is distributed under the terms of
the Apache License, Version 2.0. The full terms and conditions
of this license are detailed in the LICENSE file.

For more information, please follow the link to the
wiki page:

In the unfortunate event that bugs are discovered, they should
be reported to the appropriate bug tracker. If you obtained
the software from a 3rd party operating system vendor, it is
often wise to use their own bug tracker for reporting problems.
In all other cases use the master OpenStack bug tracker,
available at:

   https://bugs.launchpad.net/rpm-packaging

Developers wishing to work on the RPM packaging for OpenStack
project should always base their work on the latest code,
available from the master GIT repository at:

   https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/rpm-packaging

Developers should also join the discussion on the mailing list,
at:

   http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-discuss

or join the IRC channel on
